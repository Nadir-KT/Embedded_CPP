Dear Ranjith Raghavendra,

We require ISO 26262 qualified static, unit/integration, and dynamic code analysis tools to comply with IATF 16949 standards, an initiative spearheaded by our QA department. We have a stringent timeframe of four months for implementation.
Please note that the software development phase, employing traditional software development methodology, has been completed three months ago.

Development Environment:

Programming Language: Embedded C
Operating System: Microsoft Windows 10
IDE: CS+ for CC V8.10.00 (RL78, RX, RH850) + Code Generator [Applilet3 for RL78 V1.22.00]
Compiler: CC-RL compiler for RL78
Static Code Analysis Tool: CppCheck Version 2.10
We also adhere to ISO 11898 (CAN Protocol Standard), ISO/DIS 16845 (CAN Conformance Testing), and ISO/IEC 9899:C11 (Programming Standard).

We kindly request your recommendations for suitable tools that align with our requirements and development environment.

Sincerely,


Q.	Are you working on an embedded application (If yes, what is the target architecture and compiler involved)
a. Memory available on target [RAM]
b. Can you write to file system on target?

what is code coverage tool?
Code coverage is a white-box testing technique performed to verify the extent to which the code has been executed. Code coverage tools use 
static instrumentation in which statements monitoring code execution are inserted at critical junctures in the code. Now, adding instrumentation 
code does result in increased execution time and code length. But the increase is more than justified in light of the tester’s information because 
of the extra code.
Code coverage tools will use one or more criteria to determine how your code was exercised or not during the execution of your test suite. 
The common metrics that you might see mentioned in your coverage reports include.Code coverage is a metric that can help you understand
how much of your source is tested. It's a very useful metric that can help you assess the quality of your test suite, and we will see here
how you can get started with your projects. 
*Function coverage: how many of the functions defined have been called.
*Statement coverage: how many of the statements in the program have been executed.
*Branches coverage: how many of the branches of the control structures (if statements for instance) have been executed.
*Condition coverage: how many of the boolean sub-expressions have been tested for a true and a false value.
*Line coverage: how many of lines of source code have been tested.
Code coverage is primarily performed at the unit testing level. Unit tests are created by developers, thus giving them the best vantage 
from which to decide what tests to include in unit testing. At this point, code coverage answers several questions, such as:
Are there enough tests in the unit test suite? Do more tests need to be added? As development progresses, new features and fixes
are added to the codebase. The test code must be changed to stay updated with these changes. Testing standards established at the
beginning of the project must also be maintained throughout subsequent release cycles. Code coverage ensures these standards are 
maintained so that only the optimal quality code is pushed to production.
A high percentage of code coverage results in lower chances of unidentified bugs. It is best to set a minimum rate of code coverage that must be 
achieved before testing in production to reduce the chances of bugs being detected later in development.
Benefits:
1)Easy maintenance of code base – Writing scalable code is crucial to extend the software program through the introduction of new or modified functionalities. 
However, it is difficult to determine whether the written code is scalable. It can prove to be a useful metric in that context The analysis report will help 
developers to ensure code quality is well-maintained and new features can be added with little-to-no efforts.
2)Exposure of bad code – Continuous analysis will help developers to understand bad, dead, and unused code. As a result, they can improve code-writing practices,
which in turn, will result in better maintainability of the product quality.
3)Faster time to market – With the help of this metric, developers can finish the software
development process faster, thereby increasing their productivity and efficiency. As a result, they will be able to deliver more products, allowing companies to 
launch more software applications on the market in lesser time. This will undoubtedly lead to increased customer satisfaction and high ROI

dynamic code analysis?
What Is Dynamic Code Analysis: Dynamic analysis is the process of testing and evaluating a program — while software is running. Also referred to as dynamic code scanning, dynamic analysis improves the diagnosis and correction of bugs, memory issues, and crashes of an application during its execution.Dynamic code analysis can be used interchangeably with dynamic analysis. 
Why Is Dynamic Analysis Needed: Developers are under tremendous pressure to deliver clean applications faster. Dynamic code analysis tools can help them achieve
this with easy debugging of running threads and processes. Dynamic analysis tools also help illuminate performance problems and memory usage issues and memory 
leaks. Dynamic analysis testing will indicate whether an application works well; conversely, it will reveal errors indicating that an application doesn’t work as 
intended.dynamic analysis tools to help you analyze and improve your application but when it comes to debugging, TotalView is the de facto standard for run-time 
analysis and debugging of complex applications. It is a source code debugger for understanding how your multithreaded and multiprocess application runs and
troubleshooting complex programs.

Static Code Analysis?
Static code analysis is a method of debugging done by examining an application’s source code before a program is run. This is usually done by analyzing the code 
against a given set of rules or coding standards.

function?
A function is defined as a relation between a set of inputs having one output each. In simple words, a function is a relationship between inputs where each input 
is related to exactly one output. Every function has a domain and codomain or range.
